# :house: About me
**Fullstack development student | Product Analyst | API integrator**

I'm currently in the 3rd semester of **An√°lise e Desenvolvimento de Sistemas** at **FAM**, where I started my journey in August 2024.

I work at **software.com.br** as a **Product Analyst**, handling tools like **Jira** and **Bitbucket** both as a user and administrator. I also develop internal **APIs using Node.js** to connect various tools and services.

I'm passionate about technology and committed to becoming a **Full Stack Developer**. I enjoy bringing ideas to life through code and have been building personal projects that explore both front-end and back-end stacks.

One example is a system I built for the **TAF (Teste de Aptid√£o F√≠sica)** in college, using **Node.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and MongoDB**.

# :closed_book: Academy Journey
Since starting college, I‚Äôve studied:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- API development in Node.js
- NoSQL databases (MongoDB) and SQL
- Project management and agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban)
- Tool administration: Jira, Bitbucket, JSM, Confluence.

And there‚Äôs a lot more to come!
